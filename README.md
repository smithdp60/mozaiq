# Mozaiq

## Elevator pitch:

–Mozaiq is a personality assessment app that can aid in personal development and optimize interpersonal interactions by showing your app connections’ personality preferences, strengths, and weaknesses.

-The assessment uses the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), which is a psychometric questionnaire designed to measure psychological preferences in how people perceive the world and make decisions.

-A couple years ago, I started researching personality theory, and by discovering more about myself, that knowledge eventually led me to shift towards a more fitting career path.

## Tech used:

-AngularJS
-MongoDB
-Facebook OAuth / API
-Bootstrap

## If I had more time...

-Display more than one Facebook friend (will fix)
-Finish formatting type content (will fix)
-For recommended careers, add job salaries via Glassdoor API (we'll see)
-Add a live chat feature per type (we'll see)
-Add about page

## Something I learned during the project

-I learned how to use Facebook OAuth, which I had never worked with before
-I'm very excited for a more refined AngularJS 2.0

## Most challenging moment(s)
-Pushing to Heroku every time I needed to test for Facebook functionality
-Realizing Facebook friends feature wasn't working fully, then not being able to fix it in time

## Best moment(s)
-Getting the assessment logic to save/update user's type
-Feeling less dizzy looking at a Sails app
